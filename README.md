All of the classiifications and the final report are in NEO_Classification.ipynb   

Link to our classifier API, hosted on Render:   
https://cpsc322-finalproject-0itg.onrender.com/predict?estimated_diameter_min=0&estimated_diameter_max=1&relative_velocity=2&miss_distance=1   
To make a prediction, users will need to input the attribute values into the URL so that it goes predict?attribute=value&attribute=value...  
NOTE: Render may run slowly so please have patience as it generates the results of the classification
