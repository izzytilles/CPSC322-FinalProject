    "## Dataset Description\n",
    "We are using a dataset found on Kaggle called [Dinosaur Dataset](\"https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/smruthiiii/dinosaur-dataset\").  \n",
    "We are currently planning on looking at `diet` (omnivorous, carniviorous, herbivorous), `type` (small theropod, large theropod, sauropod, ornithopod, ceratopsian, armored dinosaur), `length_m` of dinosaurs as a discretized value, `max_ma` which is the age in which the first fossil records of the dinosaur were found, `min_ma` which is the age in which the last fossil records of the dinosaur were found, and `region`, to predict if the Dinosaur fossils are members of the taxonomical class `Saurischia` or `Ornithischia`.\n"

    "## Potential Impact \n",
    "Our finished product can be useful for paleontologists to determine the taxonomical class of a fossil they have just found. Often the defining feature distinguishing a Saurischian fossil from an Ornithischian fossil is the shape of their hip bones, but if a paleontologist is unable to locate that bone, this could be a helpful tool for hypothesizing.  \n",
    "This tool would be most useful to paleontologists and possibly museum curators, as those are the people most likely to have unclassified dinosaur bones in their possession. "
